<h1 class="text-primary" style=" font-family:cursive; margin-top:50px; margin-left:50px;">Alan Turing</h1>

<p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive; margin-left:50px; margin-right:50px;">also known as the father of Computing Science was a British mathematician and logician, and ultra distance runner. He was highly influential for the development of Computer Science and for providing formalisation for concept algorithm and computation with the Turing machine, considered one of the first computers of the history.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9"><h3 class="text-primary" style="text-decoration: underline;">Early Life</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">Alan Mathison Turing was born to Julius Mathison and Ethel Sara on June 23, 1912, in Paddington, London. At early life he showed signs of being a genius. In 1926, at the age of 13, he went on to Sherborne School, a well known independent school. Turing's inclination towards mathematics and science did not earn him respect from some teachers at Sherborne, whose definition of education placed more emphasis on the classics.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9"><h3 class="text-primary" style="text-decoration: underline;">University Work</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">Turing studied as an undergraduate in King's College, Cambridge, from whwere he gained the first class honours in mathematics. At the young age of 22, he was elected a fellow at King's on the strength of a dissertation in which he proved the central limit theorem. During those years Turing made the Church- Turing thesis which states that a function on the natural numbers is computable in an informal sense (i.e., computable by a human being using a pencil-and-paper method, ignoring resource limitations). This thesis is a base on computability theory.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9"><h3 class="text-primary" style="text-decoration: underline;">Cryptanalysis</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">During the Second World War, Turing was a leading participant in the breaking of German ciphers at Bletchley Park. The historian and wartime code breaker As Briggs has said, "You needed exceptional talent, you needed genius at Bletchley and Turing's was that genius.“ He created a cryptanalysis device known as the bombe that broke the Nazi code of Enigma. He concentrated on cryptanalysis of the Enigma.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9"><h3 class="text-primary" style="text-decoration: underline;">War Time</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">War Time Turing had something of a reputation for eccentricity at Bletchley Park. He was known to his colleagues as 'Prof' and his treatise on Enigma was known as 'The Prof's Book'. In 1945, Turing was awarded the OBE by King George VI for his wartime services, but his work remained secret for many years.</p>

  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">While working at Bletchley, Turing, who was a talented long-distance runner, occasionally ran the 40 miles (64 km) to London when he was needed for high-level meetings, and he was capable of world-class marathon standards. Turing tried out for the 1948 British Olympic team, hampered by an injury.</p>

  <div class="col-md-9"><h3 class="text-primary" style="text-decoration: underline;">Conviction for indecency </h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">In January 1952, Turing, then 39, started a relationship with Arnold Murray, a 19-year-old unemployed man. Homosexual acts were criminal offences in the United Kingdom at that time, and both men were charged with gross indecency under Section 11 of the Criminal Law Amendment Act 1885. He accepted the option of treatment via injections of stilboestrol, a synthetic oestrogen; this treatment was continued for the course of one year. The treatment rendered Turing impotent and caused gynaecomastia, ful filling in the literal sense Turing's prediction that "no doubt I shall emerge from it all a different man, but quite who I've not found out".</p>

  <div class="col-md-9" style="margin-top:50px;"><h3 class="text-primary" style="text-decoration: underline;">Death</h3>
  <p style="font-size:20px; font-family:cursive;">On 8 June 1954, Turing's housekeeper found him dead. He had died the previous day. A post- mortem examination established that the cause of death was cyanide poisoning. When his body was discovered, an apple lay half-eaten beside his bed, and although the apple was not tested for cyanide, it was speculated that this was the means by which a fatal dose was consumed. An inquest determined that he had committed suicide</p>
